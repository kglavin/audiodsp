Here are some software mini projects that can be used to educate about the topic of Time Domain Analysis and its sub-topics:

## Waveform Visualization:
 Create a software tool that allows users to visualize and analyze audio waveforms in the time domain. Users can input an audio file or generate simple audio signals of different frequencies and amplitudes. The tool should display the waveform graphically, with options to zoom in and out, adjust the time scale, and observe the changes in amplitude and duration. This project will help students understand the time-domain representation of audio signals and how changes in amplitude and duration affect the waveform.

## Frequency and Phase Analysis:
 Develop a software application that enables users to analyze the frequency and phase components of audio signals. Users can input an audio file or generate audio signals of different frequencies. The application should provide options to perform a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on the signal and display the resulting frequency spectrum. Additionally, the project can include a phase analysis feature that displays the phase values of the signal over time. This project will help students explore the concepts of amplitude, frequency, and phase in the time domain representation of audio signals.

## Continuous and Discrete-Time Signals:
 Create a software tool that illustrates the differences between continuous-time and discrete-time signals. Users can input an audio signal and observe its continuous-time representation on a waveform graph. The tool should also allow users to sample the continuous-time signal and visualize the resulting discrete-time representation using sequences of samples. This project will help students understand the distinction between continuous and discrete-time signals and the process of converting from one to the other through sampling.

## Discrete-Time Signal Processing:
 Build a software application that demonstrates the basics of discrete-time signal processing using sequences of audio samples. Users can input an audio signal or generate simple audio sequences. The application should provide options to perform operations such as time shifting, amplitude scaling, and convolution on the input signal and visualize the resulting output signal. This project will help students understand how discrete-time signals are manipulated and processed in the time domain.
